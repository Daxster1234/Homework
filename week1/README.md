## Definition Statement
### I want to build a website that my band can use for promotion, tickets and selling merchandise.

## Definition of Audience
### People who are interested in or fans of the band, locally or otherwise.

## Pages should be homepage, about us, contact, merch, tickets/events
### Homepage - Logo, quick introduction, maybe a video, links to other parts of the page
### About us - who we are, what we do, why you should be interested
### Contact - contact for the band and a form to send an email to me for whatever reason
### Merch - page to show merchandise and sell items
### Tickets/Events - calendar showing when and where we're playing, updated live

## Design Elements
### Dark colors, black and white, red
### Band logo
### Fonts? Will have to look around more, something readable but "edgy" fitting with the theme
